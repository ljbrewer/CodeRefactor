## The Acceptance Criteria for this project was

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
        THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
        THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
        THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
        THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
        THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
